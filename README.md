C language projects for the data structures discipline

Hi, my name is Matheus. I'm doing this repository in order to practice both my skills with git/github, as well as my skills in programming in
C. You're free to download my projects and message me if you have any questions. You can get my e-mail contact in the readme inside the "Miland24" repository in my github.

Best regards,
Matheus
